        <h2>A Little About Brendon</h2>

        <p style="font-size:18;">Brendon Boyd Urie was born on April 12, 1987 (Aries gang) in St. George, Utah. He is the youngest of 5 children 
            having two older brothers and sisters. Brendon began taking guitar lessons in highshcool where he got acquainted 
            with members that would later form Panic! At The Disco and secured his role as lead vocalist. In 2005 the band 
            released their debut album 'A Fever You Can't Sweat Out' and has since had several singles reach top 10 in the US;
             one of which was nominated for a Grammy award. Brendon is the last remaining original member since he replaced the
              lead vocalist. The American singer married Sarah Orzechowski in 2013 and does not have any children. Urie spends
               his time mentoring children and has even opened a music studio for young children to explore their talents.</p>
